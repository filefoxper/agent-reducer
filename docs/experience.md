# Experience

We have add some experience features and APIs. These features and APIs may be changing in future, and we suppose you try them privately not in your production codes. If you want to use them please set `process.env.AGENT_REDUCER_EXPERIENCE` to `OPEN`, and use [manual compile](/introduction?id=manual-compile) to recompile agent-reducer. Or, you can use API [experience](/api?id=experience) to open it.
