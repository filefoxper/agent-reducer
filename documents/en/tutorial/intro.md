# Intro

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) or standard `unit test`, and we will write examples by `unit test` style.

In this tutorial, we will build a searching page model, and show how this model works. If you are interested in building a simple web app, please waiting for the tutorial of [use-agent-reducer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-agent-reducer).
